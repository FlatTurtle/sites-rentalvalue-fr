 	   parameters, relying on 16 years property experience*.<br /></p>

 	   <p>They implement the suggestions from the buildingClinique™ and design
 	   such an engaging, memorable & desirable “viewing experience” for potential
 	   tenants* that they “want” your property. These suggested cosmetic changes
 	   and add-ons make your property perform and stand out from the lot.
 	   They explain and communicate its unique value proposition to prospective
 	   tenants. Making sense to prospective tenants, these tools maximise
 	   your chances for a leasing.<br /></p>

 	   <p>Our lettingTools™ attract more visits by brokers since they increase
 	   the likelihood of a good visit and of a deal. Pure enhancement.<br /></p>

 	   <small>* They’ll spend less than 15 minutes viewing your property.</small>
